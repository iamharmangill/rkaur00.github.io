**Tutorial Guide for making Simple Billing Application using Node.js and Express:**

In this tutorial, I am going to build the billing system of a coffee shop. In this application, I am going to use node.js and express framework, bootstrap, html and embedded JavaScript. I am not going to use any database for storing data, I am actually making use of data.json file which holds the array of items I want to display on my browser screen. First, I would like to give you brief description of the technology that I am using in this application, after that we will actually start building the practical code:

**Node.js:** It provides runtime environment for JavaScript code. It enables us to use asynchronous programming. To understand this concept let’s take an example of synchronous coding with PHP, if one task is going on, the system is not able to take another request, it will process the next task only when one completes. So, this means user have to wait, but Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.Node.js runs single-threaded, asynchronously programming, which makes it very memory efficient.

**Express:** It is the web-application framework of node.js that provides access to useful API’s and middleware. Middleware are basically a piece of code that access the request, can send respond and also have access to next request. It also has views that are used to display the user interface. For view you can just make use of static page like HTML or JavaScript file. For this project I am making use of embedded JavaScript File (ejs).

**To give you a glimpse of my end result, Following are the snapshots of output screen:**

-When you will fill the above form and select the coffee you want, it will generate the result showing your filled name along with the bill for your coffee.

 Now we will start building our project:
 
- Before building this app, there are some pre-installations required. You need:

**Node.js:** To download node.js package and install this on your system, follow this site: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**NPM:** It stands for node package management. Install it from [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

To check whether installations are done successfully or not, open terminal (for mac) or cmd (for windows) and type:

**node -v and npm -v** These commands would return version of your installed softwares and indicate they are installed successfully.

**Express:** You not need it now, but to install express open terminal and type:
        **npm install express –save**

**Editor:** I am using visual studio code to write my code.

The file structure that I am using is:

![Image](/Images/filestructure.png)

Create a folder on your desktop with name “billingsystem” and open it in visual studio code.
Now add a file to this folder with name “server.js”, which acts as an entry port for your project. Now you need package.json which contains all your dependencies you are using in your project. A package.json file must contain "name" and "version" fields.
- To build package.json file, open your system terminal or the terminal of VS code and type:
- npm init -y
- You will get file like below:
![Image](/Images/package.png)
- Now install express by typing in terminal:
**npm install express --save**
By using this command, the express module is installed in your project and you can check it in your package.json file under dependencies. This will also automatically generate **package-lock.json** file and also **node_modules folder**.
- Now we should begin by writng a simple code of "hello world" to understand the concept. Open server.js file and write the following code:
![Image](/Images/image3.png)
Now open the terminal of your editor and type **node server.js**
- It will show **Server started on port 3000...** and now open browser and type **http://localhost:3000/** and you will get "hello World!" as result. 
- Now to understand the concept start from first line,

var express = require('express'); // This will import express module and create express application.

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!')) //This route path will match requests to the root route and send "Hello World!" message.

app.listen(3000,function()
{
    console.log('Server started on port 3000...');
}); // This specify the server is listening at port 3000.

Now first, I am going to build **data.json** file, that contains the array of objects I wanted to display on output screen.
Since I am building a billing system for coffee shop, the data contains the information about the type of coffee along with its price. The code for **data.json** file is as follows:

 ```
 [
    {
       "name":"Latte",
       "price":4
},
    {
        "name":"Chocolate",
        "price":8
    },
    {
        "name":"Vanilla",
        "price":2
    },
        
    {
        "name":"Cappuccino",
        "price":6
    }
]
 ```
Now open your **server.js** file and modify the file using following code:

```
const express = require('express');

const port=3000;

var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

var path = require('path');

var fs=require('fs');

var data=fs.readFileSync('data.json');

var words=JSON.parse(data);

console.log(words);

var app=express();

app.listen(port,function(){
    console.log('Server started on port ...');
});


```
- In the above code, we are using body-parser middleware,used for parsing the requests coming from form. To use it, first we need to import it in our code, open your terminal and type : **npm install --save body-parser** and you will see it under dependencies in package.json file.
- Path is used to simplify the path. It is a core module, so no need to install explicitly.
- To import any external file in index.js file, we use file system, which is a core module; so no need to install explicitly.
- In the above code, we are getting the data from **data.json** file in data varible and to convert it into readable string, we are parsing that data into words variable.
- Run the code by typing **node server.js** and you will get the data of **data.json** in terminal. 
![Image](/Images/image4.png)
So, upto now we are successfull in reading the content of external file. 

Now add following code above app.listen in **server.js** file:

```
app.set('view engine','ejs');

app.set('views',path.join(__dirname,'views'));

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}));

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,'images')));

app.get('/',function(req,res){

res.render('index1',{
    words: words,
    data:' '
});
});
```
- The first line of code is used to set view engine which is .ejs file, Since it is under views folder, the second line of code provides the path for that. We need to install ejs module the same way we did for body-parser, open your terminal and type **npm install --save ejs**
- bodyParser is used to parse data from form that we are going to use in **index.ejs** file and since we are getting data from browser which is in encoded form; we are using fourth line of code to decode that.
- As from output screen, you get to now that I am using background image for styling and to use it in my project, I need to define it here using fifth line of code.
- The next lines of code are sending the data in object format to **index.ejs** file.

Now I am going to build **index.ejs** file which is under **views** folder. As defined earlier, views are used to display user interface. I am using embedded JavaScript file that contains bootstrap along with JavaScript functionality. You can simply use html form code, but for better display I am using bootstrap. you can copy bootstrap starter template from [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/introduction/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/introduction/) 
- Between the <body> tags add the following code:
 
 ```
 <body>
  <form method="post" action="/result"> 
            <div class="form-group">
             <label for="formGroupExampleInput">Name</label>
             <input type="text" class="form-control" id="formGroupExampleInput" name="name" placeholder="Customer Name">
                  </div>
        <div class="form-group">
          <label for="exampleInputEmail1">Email address</label>
          <input type="email" class="form-control" name="email" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp" placeholder="Enter email">
        </div>
        <div class="row">
                <% words.forEach(function(item){ %>
                    <div class="col">
                      <div class="form-check">
                            <input class="form-check-input" type="checkbox" id="gridCheck1" name="<%- item.name %>" >
                            <label class="form-check-label" for="gridCheck1">
                                    <%- item.name %>
                            </label>
                      </div> 
                    </div>
                <% }); %>
          </div>
      
                          <br><br>
         <div class="text-center"><button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary  btn-lg ">Submit</button></div>
    </form>
    </body>
```
So, in the above code we are using a form that has two input fields; name and email.
- We are getting the text for checkboxes from words variable that we have rendered to this page using **server.js** code. Thus, we are generating dynamic content from **data.json** file. Now if you run your code and open browser and type [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), you will get following display:

![Image](/Images/image5.png)

Now we are going to add functionality by getting the data submitted in form. when user will press the submit button, we will send the data back to **server.js** file using post method. Since, we have used action for form to be a result page, add the following code to your previous code in server.js file:

```
var amount=0;
app.post('/result',function(req,res){
    
    console.log('form submitted');
   
    const otherData = req.body;
   Object.keys(otherData).forEach(function(key){
        if (key != "name" && key!="email")
        {
            console.log("the value of " + key + " is " + otherData[key] + " and its price is " + (words.find(item=>item.name===key)).price);
            var fare=(words.find(item=>item.name===key)["price"]);
           console.log(fare);
           amount+=fare;
        console.log(amount);
        }
       
      });
fname=req.body.name;
email=req.body.email;
res.render('index1',{
    words:words,
   data: fname+" your total bill is $"+amount
  
});

 amount=0;

})
```
In the above code,on click on submit button I am getting data from form using request method:
- using req.body, I am getting everything within the form.
- To get the data of checkboxes only, I am neglecting the data coming from name and email fields by using if statement.
- key is holding the data of checkboxes
- by comparing the key with words variable(that is holding the name and price for each coffee), we will generate the bill for the customer.
- fname is holding the name we filled in name input field.
- email is holding the name we filled in email input field.
- The snapshot of output screen (after selecting coffee and filling name) showing result:
![Image](/Images/image6.png)

Now we need to add some error validor so that user cannot enter invalid data or leave the input fields unfilled, I am using express validator. To install it,open your terminal and type **npm install express-validator --save** 
- Also you need to update your server.js code as following:

```
const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator/check');
var errors=null;
app.get('/',function(req,res){
res.render('index',{
    words: words,
    data:' ',
    errors:' '
});
});
app.post('/result',[

    check('name').isLength({ min: 3 }),

    check('email').isEmail()

],(req,res)=>{
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    
    
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) 
      {
           res.render('index',{
            words: words,
            data:' ',
            errors:"Enter valid name and email address"
        });
    }
      
      else
      {
    console.log('form submitted');
     
     // use the same code.....
       });
```
- Now, if the user enter data without name or email, the output will not show result even if the coffee is selected, user will get error message.

Upto now we have successfully made a billing system of coffee shop. For more clarification, the complete code for **server.js** is:

```
const express = require('express'); 

const port=3000;

var bodyParser = require('body-parser');

var path = require('path');

var fs=require('fs');

var data=fs.readFileSync('data.json');

var words=JSON.parse(data);

const { check, validationResult } = require('express-validator/check');

var app=express();


var errors=null;
var amount=0;

app.set('view engine','ejs');
app.set('views',path.join(__dirname,'views'));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}));
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname,'images')));

app.get('/',function(req,res){
res.render('index',{
    words: words,
    data:' ',
    errors:' '
});
});

app.post('/result',[

    check('name').isLength({ min: 3 }),

    check('email').isEmail()

],(req,res)=>{
    const errors = validationResult(req);
    
    
    if (!errors.isEmpty()) 
      {
           res.render('index',{
            words: words,
            data:' ',
            errors:"Enter valid name and email address"
        });
    }
      
      else
      {
    console.log('form submitted');
    const otherData = req.body;
    
    Object.keys(otherData).forEach(function(key){
        if (key != "name" && key!="email")
        {
            console.log("You Ordered: " + key + " ,Price: " + (words.find(item=>item.name===key)).price);
            var fare=(words.find(item=>item.name===key)["price"]);
            amount+=fare;
       
        }
       });

       name=req.body.name;
       email=req.body.email;

       res.render('index',{
       words:words,
       data: name+" your total bill is $"+amount,
       errors: '' 
  
});

        amount=0;
      }
});

    app.listen(port,function(){
    console.log('Server started on port ...');
});


```
Now, at last I am just adding the background image using inline style at body tag, and, also handling client side error using jquery validation for name and email fields, so that user cannot enter invalid data.To display the server side error, I am displaying it using the error variable coming from server.js file and similarly to display my result, I am using JavaScript expression to display it using data variable rendering from server.js file.Complete code for index.ejs file is:

```

Screenshot of output screens:
- When user try to submit without entering name or email, jquery validation will handle that.

![Image](/Images/image9.png)

- JQuery will guide the user to fill the correct data

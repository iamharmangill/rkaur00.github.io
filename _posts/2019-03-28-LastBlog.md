# [ My Last Blog for Second Project - Future Work and Lessons Learned]({% post_url 2019-03-28-LastBlog %})

- This week I worked with styling and implementing the delete operations from firestore database.
- I have successfully implemented the features that I have thought in the beginning.
- My application looks like this:
- Home Page

- Contact Page

**Lessons Learned:** Throughout the course of implementing this application, I have learned a lot about Angular. I learned about components: how to make interaction between templates and code, data binding, use of directives to alternate or manipulate the attributes of HTML and routing. I faced many problems in the beginning, it was very difficult to understand the complex architecture of Angular. But step-by-step knowledge of all features I gained through watching the tutorials helped me a lot. The documentation of Angular is also a great source of information for novice to start with. 
First, I made the application without using database, But then I decided to implement some back-end to store my data. I learned how to use firebase in angular framework. The time period of making this application was very crucial for me as I experiment with many new features of Angular7.

**Overall Performance:** I think I have worked hard on building this application. In beginning, my speed was quite slow, buit with experience I gained confidence and I learned many new features and made this application working.

**Future Work:**  I have successfully reached the goals that I had set when I started building this application. For future modification, I would like to make three lists, out of which one is for todo, other is for doing and the third one is for done. I would like to create something like trello [https://trello.com/](https://trello.com/).

**Important Notes to make this Application working:**
- To run this application, you need to have angular cli installed on your system. For that you must have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.
- To install angular cli, type **npm install -g @angular/cli** on your terminal.
- Once you have cli installed, open the terminal of your editor and type **ng serve** and open your browser and type **http://localhost:4200/** which is a default port for Angular.

First Project: I chose Node.js for my first project in which I will make use of express framework to make my project. I am going for this as node.js is one of the fast-emerging language of today's era and I really want to have good command over this topic. Moreover, this language executes the code fast and NPM is also a new concept to learn.
The event-driven architecture of this language is very helpful in making real-time web-applications which would surely help me to make major projects in future.

Idea of my first Project: As a beginner I have to do a lot of setups to even run my first code. So, for my first project I would go for some billing application which takes the input from user and according to the items choosen by user, it will print the bill for user.

Tasks to do/deliverables: 
1. My first work is to have basic knowledge of Node.js and have all the setups done on my machine.
2. Then I would run my first Node.js code and research more to make my work done.
3. Then I will create the prototype of my project and work on them accordingly. 
- For my project prototype, I thought of taking the concept of a coffee shop where user will ask for particular coffee and accordingly the bill would be generated automatically.
- I would use the form for taking the input of user and by clicking on submit button, the price will be generated automatically.

Second Project: For second project I would either go for any database like Mongo DB/MySQL or I will go for Spring.

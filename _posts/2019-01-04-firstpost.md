I chose Node.js for my first project in which I will make use of express framework to make my project. I am going for this as node.js is one of the fast emerging language of today's era and I really want to have good command over this topic. Moreover, this language executes the code fast and NPM is also a new concept to learn.
The event-driven archtitecture of this language is very helpful in making real-time web-applications which would surely help me to make major projects in future.

Idea of my first Project: As a beginner I have to do a lot of setups to even run my first code. So, for my first project I would go for some billing application which takes the input from user and according to the items choosen by user, it will print the bill for user.

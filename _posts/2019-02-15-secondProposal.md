For second project, I am going to use Angular which is a powerful framework for JavaScript. I have chosen Angular as it is one of the most commonly used industry languages. So, to get command on it, this course is the best chance for me. The prerequisites for learning angular are HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which I already know, and I think this is the favorable time to go beyond this.

**Till now what I learned about Angular is that:**
-	It is library written in JavaScript.
-	AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives and binds data to HTML with Expressions.
-	The ng-app directive defines that we are using an AngularJS application. So, if we put ng-app with any <div>, it means that div is the owner of AngularJS application.
- The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML form to application data. So, use of this with any input field would bind the value of that field with a variable.
-	The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view which means it binds data of any <p> or heading tag with the given variable.
-	AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces.

**Advantages of Angular:**
-	Rapid development and code generation
-	Code organization and control through cli commands
-	Dynamic content within HTML templates
-	Cross platform
-	Core features: Components, services, Routing, Templating, Events, TypeScript, Directives, Data binding, Validation and so on.

**Proposal for Project:**
Since Angular is a new concept for me where I have to learn a lot about directives, services, expressions, events and routing and validation, I would like to make a Todo list application:
- Where I will have two pages: Home and Contact form - This would help me to learn the concept of routing.
- Through the form I would learn the concept of Angular Validation.
- I would make two lists and make use of drag and drop property to move the data from todo list to done list.
- I will make use of firebase as my back-end to store and retrieve data.
-	With the passage of time, I would like to enhance the functionality of project according to the skills I got in Angular.

Hence, for now I am taking the concept of making todolist application where user can track his work and a dynamic form where users would enter data and performs some kind of functionality.

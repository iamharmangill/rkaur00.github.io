# [ My First Blog for Second Project ]({% post_url 2019-02-22-firstBlog %})

This week I have started learning Angular and install the few packages required to run my first "hello world!" program.

To run a basic Angular program, you need:

**NPM**: It is Node Package Manager. It is required to install angular cli. When we install Node.js in our system, it gets downloaded automatically.
 To download angular cli using npm, open your terminal and type:
  
  **npm install -g @angular/cli**
  
  Now to create a new project, type **ng new projectName** in your terminal and this will create a Angular project.
  
  The editor that I am using is visual studio code, and to run angular program with this you need to provide extensions to run angular and to do so,
  in your visual studio code open **View->Command Palette->Extensions and Install Extensions-> Angular7 Snippets and install it**.
  
 To run your project, you need to type **ng serve** and it will start the project at defaut host **http://localhost:4200/**.
  
  This week, I also learned a bit about the components, they comprises of three main parts: HTML templating, Logic or functionality and styling(CSS) part.

# [ My Third Blog for Second Project ]({% post_url 2019-03-08-thirdBlog %})
This week I learned about drag and drop property of Angular and to generate, add and delete posts.
- First, I made a list. Then, I add some todo posts in it.
- Then I implement the concept of deleting posts.
- After that I made use of drag and drop property to reorder the posts in that list.
- After that I made another empty list and move the posts of first list into the another list using the drag and drop property.

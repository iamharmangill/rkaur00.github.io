This week I worked on making my project dynamic.
1. I created a form using bootstrap which consist the name and email field and the checkboxes field that comprises of the type of coffee availble at store.
2. The framework I am using is Express and for view I am using Embedded Javascript File.

For next week I would work on adding the validation code to my project and start writing my tutorial.

# [ My Fourth Blog for Second Project ]({% post_url 2019-03-15-fourthBlog %})
- This week I did not get much time to work on project.
- I worked on learning the validations on form and implement them successfully.
- I also watched some tutorials for database connection.
- For next week, I will probably make database connection and start storing my todolists on that.

This week I installed the required stuff to run my node.js program. I am using mac operating system to make this mini project. I made the following setups:

1.	Install node.js from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
2.	Install NPM (Node Package Manager) 
3.	Install Homebrew – It helps to install packages easily. I installed it from [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)
4.	Install NVM (Node Version Control) – I installed it using homebrew by following this tutorial :     [https://www.codementor.io/mercurial/how-to-install-node-js-on-macos-sierra-mphz41ekk](https://www.codementor.io/mercurial/how-to-install-node-js-on-macos-sierra-mphz41ekk)
5.	I am using express framework of node.js, Type npm install express –save in terminal to install express in your system and I used the guidelines from [https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html)
6.	Then I made my first ‘Hello World!’ program and run it.
7.	For next week, I am going to work on my project of making a billing system.

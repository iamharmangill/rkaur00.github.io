This week I installed the required stuff to run my node.js program. I am using mac operating system to make this mini project. I made the following setups:

•	Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/ 
•	Install NPM (Node Package Manager) 
•	Install Homebrew – It helps to install packages easily. I installed it from https://brew.sh/
•	Install NVM (Node Version Control) – I installed it using homebrew by following this tutorial : https://www.codementor.io/mercurial/how-to-install-node-js-on-macos-sierra-mphz41ekk
•	I am using express framework of node.js, Type npm install express –save in terminal to install express in your system and I used the guidelines from https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html
•	Then I made my first ‘Hello World!’ program and run it.
•	For next week, I am going to work on my project of making a billing system.
